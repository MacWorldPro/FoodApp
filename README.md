Developed on MERN stack, this is a food ordering application. A special feature of this app is that it fetches real-time items from Swiggy Api and displays them in real time. I have included all the features that any food ordering website needs, including adding items to cart, giving feedback, logging in, signing up, sending feedback, viewing your own profile, etc. I have used chakra UI for the user interface. For feedback, emailJS is used. For payments, Stripe is used.
